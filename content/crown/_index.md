# Welcome to Tu'um Mundi
Tu'um Mundi is a world thrice shattered, standing in between the old age and the new. Powerful individuals rule over countries as God-Kings, wearing the ancient all-powerful Crowns, having stolen the title of "Dragons" from the ancient beasts that made them. In the empty space between them, people live in city-states and sovereign villages.

The world is covered in the ruins of an empire of the old age, brought low by the war of the last shattering. The war left the land scarred, the edges of the land now disappear into nothingness, an impassable void, and the grave of the old empire's capital sit in the center. Adventurers spend entire lifetimes exploring these ruins, looking for fame and fortune, and often finding only injury or death.

This is world, a story, about Power. About Violence. And about having the Will to change the world
